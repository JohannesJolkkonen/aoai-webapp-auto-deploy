# [Preview] Sample Chat App with AOAI

This repo contains sample code for a simple chat webapp that integrates with Azure OpenAI. Note: some portions of the app use preview APIs.

## Prerequisites
- An existing Azure OpenAI resource and model deployment of a chat model (e.g. `gpt-35-turbo-16k`, `gpt-4`)
- To use Azure OpenAI on your data: an existing Azure Cognitive Search resource and index.

## Deploy the app

### Deploy with Azure Developer CLI
Please see [README_azd.md](./README_azd.md) for detailed instructions.

### One click Azure deployment
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fsample-app-aoai-chatGPT%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2Fdeployment.json)

Click on the Deploy to Azure button and configure your settings in the Azure Portal as described in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

Please see the [section below](#add-an-identity-provider) for important information about adding authentication to your app.

### Deploy from your local machine

#### Local Setup: Basic Chat Experience
1. Update the environment variables listed in `app.py` as described in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section.
    
    These variables are required:
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

    These variables are optional:
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_TOP_P`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_STOP_SEQUENCE`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`

    See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference#example-response-2) for more information on these parameters.

2. Start the app with `start.cmd`. This will build the frontend, install backend dependencies, and then start the app.

3. You can see the local running app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

#### Local Setup: Chat with your data (Preview)
[More information about Azure OpenAI on your data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data)

1. Update the `AZURE_OPENAI_*` environment variables as described above. 
2. To connect to your data, you need to specify an Azure Cognitive Search index to use. You can [create this index yourself](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal) or use the [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal/chat) to create the index for you.

    These variables are required when adding your data:
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_KEY`

    These variables are optional:
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_USE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CONFIG`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_TOP_K`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_ENABLE_IN_DOMAIN`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_CONTENT_COLUMNS`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_FILENAME_COLUMN`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_TITLE_COLUMN`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_URL_COLUMN`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_VECTOR_COLUMNS`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_TYPE`
    - `AZURE_SEARCH_PERMITTED_GROUPS_COLUMN`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT`
    - `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_KEY`

3. Start the app with `start.cmd`. This will build the frontend, install backend dependencies, and then start the app.
4. You can see the local running app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

#### Local Setup: Enable Chat History
To enable chat history, you will need to set up CosmosDB resources. The ARM template in the `infrastructure` folder can be used to deploy an app service and a CosmosDB with the database and container configured. Then specify these additional environment variables: 
- `AZURE_COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT`
- `AZURE_COSMOSDB_DATABASE`
- `AZURE_COSMOSDB_CONVERSATIONS_CONTAINER`
- `AZURE_COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_KEY`

As above, start the app with `start.cmd`, then visit the local running app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

#### Deploy with the Azure CLI
**NOTE**: If you've made code changes, be sure to **build the app code** with `start.cmd` or `start.sh` before you deploy, otherwise your changes will not be picked up. If you've updated any files in the `frontend` folder, make sure you see updates to the files in the `static` folder before you deploy.

You can use the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to deploy the app from your local machine. Make sure you have version 2.48.1 or later.

If this is your first time deploying the app, you can use [az webapp up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-up). Run the following command from the root folder of the repo, updating the placeholder values to your desired app name, resource group, location, and subscription. You can also change the SKU if desired.

`az webapp up --runtime PYTHON:3.10 --sku B1 --name <new-app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <azure-region> --subscription <subscription-name>`

If you've deployed the app previously, first run this command to update the appsettings to allow local code deployment:

`az webapp config appsettings set -g <resource-group-name> -n <existing-app-name> --settings WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM=false`

Check the runtime stack for your app by viewing the app service resource in the Azure Portal. If it shows "Python - 3.10", use `PYTHON:3.10` in the runtime argument below. If it shows "Python - 3.11", use `PYTHON:3.11` in the runtime argument below. 

Check the SKU in the same way. Use the abbreviated SKU name in the argument below, e.g. for "Basic (B1)" the SKU is `B1`. 

Then, use the `az webapp up` command to deploy your local code to the existing app:

`az webapp up --runtime <runtime-stack> --sku <sku> --name <existing-app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

Make sure that the app name and resource group match exactly for the app that was previously deployed.

Deployment will take several minutes. When it completes, you should be able to navigate to your app at {app-name}.azurewebsites.net.

### Add an identity provider
After deployment, you will need to add an identity provider to provide authentication support in your app. See [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) for more information.

If you don't add an identity provider, the chat functionality of your app will be blocked to prevent unauthorized access to your resources and data. To remove this restriction, or add further access controls, update the logic in `getUserInfoList` in `frontend/src/pages/chat/Chat.tsx`. For example, disable the authorization check like so:
```
const getUserInfoList = async () => {
        setShowAuthMessage(false);
}
```

## Best Practices
Feel free to fork this repository and make your own modifications to the UX or backend logic. For example, you may want to expose some of the settings in `app.py` in the UI for users to try out different behaviors. We recommend keeping these best practices in mind:

- Reset the chat session (clear chat) if the user changes any settings. Notify the user that their chat history will be lost.
- Clearly communicate to the user what impact each setting will have on their experience.
- When you rotate API keys for your AOAI or ACS resource, be sure to update the app settings for each of your deployed apps to use the new key.
- Pull in changes from `main` frequently to ensure you have the latest bug fixes and improvements, especially when using Azure OpenAI on your data.

## Environment variables

Note: settings starting with `AZURE_SEARCH` are only needed when using Azure OpenAI on your data. If not connecting to your data, you only need to specify `AZURE_OPENAI` settings.
